# Arch Workstation

This is a management suite for an Arch Linux workstation configuration. It is
meant to be an aide in creating your personal configuration for Arch Linux.

It provides a means of running your configuration in a virtual machine, and
testing the result. This allows for testing changes to your system, without
having to affect your currently running system, or having to validate whether
your configuration covers installing, and setting up everything from a fresh
install.
